This data is like a logbook for electricity, showing how the voltage changes from moment to moment.
The voltage isn't flat; it goes up and down in a regular, wave-like pattern. 
You can see lots of sharp spikes, which means the power level is changing very quickly. 
It almost looks like a heartbeat, showing the flow of electricity. 
Overall, these swings tell you how stable or jumpy the electrical supply is.

The voltage readings fluctuate between approximately 25V and 100V over the recorded time period.

There are several flat segments in the graph, indicating periods where the voltage remained constant before changing again.

The overall trendline shows a slight downward slope, suggesting a gradual decrease in voltage across the observation period.

Sudden jumps in voltage values may indicate operational changes, load variations, or measurement intervals capturing transient events.

The relatively high RÂ² value from the trendline equation would indicate how consistently the data follows the overall decreasing trend.
